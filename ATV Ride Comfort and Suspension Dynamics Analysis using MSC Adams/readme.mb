ATV Ride Comfort and Suspension Dynamics Analysis using MSC Adams

[1] Built and simulated an ATV multibody model to analyse vertical ride comfort and vibration modes.
[2] Performed FFT, modal, and transfer-function analysis to identify heave, pitch, roll, and wheel-hop modes.
[3] Conducted suspension parameter studies on damping and stiffness, including nonlinear damper behaviour.
[4] Evaluated ride comfort impact on stochastic and bump road profiles.
